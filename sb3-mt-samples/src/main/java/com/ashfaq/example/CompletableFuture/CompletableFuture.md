If we don't define threads for the `ExecutorService` or `CompletableFuture`, Java uses the **ForkJoinPool.commonPool** by default for `CompletableFuture` tasks. Here’s what that means and how it works:

### What is the ForkJoinPool.commonPool?
The `ForkJoinPool.commonPool` is a shared, general-purpose thread pool provided by the `ForkJoinPool` class. This pool is available to the entire application and is used as the default thread pool for many parallel tasks in Java, including those created by `CompletableFuture`.

### Default Behavior Without Defining Threads
1. **Thread Pool Size**: The default `ForkJoinPool.commonPool` uses a number of threads equal to the **number of available processors (CPU cores)** on your machine minus one. For instance, if your machine has 8 CPU cores, it will use a pool of 7 threads by default.
  
2. **Task Execution**: If more tasks are submitted than there are available threads, the additional tasks **wait** until a thread becomes available. This means that tasks may get queued up and processed as threads complete existing tasks.

3. **Blocking**: Since the `commonPool` is shared among different tasks across the entire application, if one task blocks (e.g., waiting on I/O or network response), it may tie up one of the threads, which can affect other tasks that use the pool.

4. **Limitations**: For high-throughput or I/O-heavy tasks, the limited number of threads in `commonPool` can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially since it’s shared with other parts of the application.

### Potential Issues with Using Default Pool
- **Resource Contention**: If multiple components of your application use the `commonPool` heavily, they may contend for threads, leading to slowdowns.
- **Non-dedicated Threads**: Since the threads are shared across the application, there’s a chance of interference with other parts of the system, especially if you have tasks with high CPU or memory needs.
- **Reduced Control**: You can’t easily change the size or behavior of the `commonPool` during runtime, which limits your control over resource allocation.

### Example of Default Behavior
Here’s what it looks like without specifying an executor:

```java
CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task running in default pool: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
});
```

In this example:
- The task runs on one of the threads in the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool`.
- we won’t see the thread pool size or any specific configuration unless you change the JVM settings.

### When to Define Your Own Executor
- **Heavy Workloads**: If your application performs many concurrent tasks, defining your own executor gives you better control and isolation for your tasks.
- **Non-blocking Tasks**: If tasks might block for a long time (e.g., waiting on external resources), a custom executor with more threads than available CPU cores can prevent the system from stalling.
- **Scalability**: Custom executors allow fine-tuning for the specific workload, enabling better resource utilization, stability, and performance.

### Conclusion
While using the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool` is convenient, it’s not ideal for high-demand, I/O-bound, or specialized tasks. Creating a custom `ExecutorService` for `CompletableFuture` gives you more control, prevents resource contention, and can optimize our application’s concurrency handling.
