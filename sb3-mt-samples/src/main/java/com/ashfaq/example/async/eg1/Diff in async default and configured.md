The difference between using `@Async` with the default configuration and using `@Async` with a custom configuration (like we did by defining our own executor bean).

### 1. Default `@Async` (Without Custom Bean)

When you use `@Async` without specifying an executor bean:
- Spring will automatically use its **default executor**. By default, this is a `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor`.
- The `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` does **not have a fixed thread pool**; it creates a **new thread for each task**. This could lead to **high memory usage** if a large number of requests arrive at once because each request will spawn a new thread.
- There’s **no built-in queue** or **thread pool management**. So, it doesn’t enforce any maximum number of threads or queue capacity.
  
In essence, with the default setup, Spring does all the heavy lifting but doesn’t limit the number of threads, which could make it less suitable for applications needing efficient thread management.

### 2. Custom `@Async` with Specified Bean (e.g., `@Async("customExecutor")`)

When you use `@Async` with a specific bean (like `@Async("customExecutor")`):
- You have control over **thread pool settings** through configurations in your custom executor. You can set core pool size, max pool size, queue capacity, etc.
- It allows for **better resource management**. For example, by setting a maximum pool size, you prevent your application from creating an unlimited number of threads.
- You can specify **rejection policies** to handle cases where the pool and queue are fully used.
- This setup is much more **scalable** and **predictable** for applications that have specific concurrency needs or limited resources.

### Example Scenario

Let’s consider a scenario where there are **twenty requests** to an API endpoint that uses an async method. Here’s how each setup would handle it:

1. **Default `@Async`**:
   - It will create a new thread for each of the twenty requests.
   - This could result in high memory usage as twenty threads are created.

2. **Custom `@Async("customExecutor")` with Configurations**:
   - If configured with `corePoolSize = 2`, `maxPoolSize = 5`, and `queueCapacity = 10`:
   - The executor will handle the first **two requests** with core threads.
   - Up to **five requests** will be handled by creating additional threads up to the max pool size.
   - The next **ten requests** will wait in the queue.
   - Beyond this, if more than **seventeen requests** arrive, the rejection policy will take effect.

### Summary Table

| **Aspect**                | **Default `@Async`** | **Custom `@Async("customExecutor")`**               |
|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Thread Pool Type**      | SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor (creates a new thread for each task) | ThreadPoolTaskExecutor (configurable thread pool) |
| **Core Pool Size**        | Not applicable       | Configurable (e.g., 2)                               |
| **Max Pool Size**         | Not applicable       | Configurable (e.g., 5)                               |
| **Queue Capacity**        | No queue             | Configurable (e.g., 10)                              |
| **Rejection Policy**      | Not available        | Configurable (e.g., AbortPolicy, CallerRunsPolicy)   |
| **Use Case**              | Suitable for lightweight or non-intensive tasks | Suitable for scalable, resource-limited scenarios    |

Using a custom executor with `@Async` gives you fine control over how tasks are handled in the background, especially under high load, making it ideal for production applications with specific resource management needs.
