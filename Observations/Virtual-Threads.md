## Java Virtual Threads - Deep Understanding (Reference Document)

---

### **1️⃣ What are Virtual Threads?**

**Definition:**

Virtual Threads are lightweight threads introduced in Java 19 (as preview) and made stable in Java 21. They are not tied 1:1 to OS threads. Instead, many Virtual Threads can run (be multiplexed) on a small pool of OS threads, managed by the JVM.

In traditional Java (Platform Threads), each thread is backed by a native OS thread. Creating thousands of threads caused heavy memory use and CPU overhead due to context switching.

With Virtual Threads:

* Millions of threads can be created.
* They handle blocking operations efficiently by "parking" instead of occupying OS threads.
* The developer writes normal Java code (imperative style).

**Example:** If a Virtual Thread is waiting for a DB response, it parks — freeing the underlying OS thread — and the JVM scheduler runs another Virtual Thread on that OS thread.

---

### **2️⃣ How were threads managed before Virtual Threads?**

Before Java 19 (Platform Threads only):

* Each Java thread = one native OS thread.
* OS allocated \~1 MB stack memory per thread.
* Blocking operations (DB calls, file IO, network IO) would block the OS thread.
* Too many threads caused high memory and CPU usage (context switching).
* The OS scheduler managed threads.

With Virtual Threads:

* Threads are managed by the JVM scheduler.
* Stack grows dynamically.
* Blocking operations do not block OS threads — instead, Virtual Threads park.
* JVM multiplexes many Virtual Threads on a small number of carrier OS threads.

---

### **3️⃣ How does parking work in Virtual Threads?**

When a Virtual Thread performs a blocking operation (e.g. database query, network call), it is parked by the JVM:

* Its state (call stack, registers) is saved in memory.
* The underlying OS thread (carrier thread) is freed.
* When IO completes, the JVM un-parks the Virtual Thread and schedules it again.

Parking = thread is logically blocked, but no OS thread is wasted.

### **4️⃣ Why are Platform Threads heavier than Virtual Threads?**

| Aspect         | Platform Thread       | Virtual Thread              |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Backing        | 1 native OS thread    | Managed by JVM              |
| Memory usage   | \~1 MB per thread     | Stack grows dynamically     |
| Context switch | OS-managed, expensive | JVM-managed, lightweight    |
| Blocking calls | Block OS thread       | Parks Virtual Thread        |
| Scalability    | Limited               | Massive (millions possible) |

Platform Threads use heavy OS resources — Virtual Threads are cheap and lightweight.

### **5️⃣ What does "multiplexed over a small pool of OS threads" mean?**

Multiplexing = many things share fewer resources.

In Virtual Threads:

* Many Virtual Threads share a small number of OS threads (carrier threads).
* JVM scheduler maps Virtual Threads to carrier threads as needed.
* When a Virtual Thread blocks, the OS thread is freed to run another Virtual Thread.

Example:

* 2 carrier OS threads
* 1000 Virtual Threads

JVM keeps running Virtual Threads on the available OS threads — similar to an event loop.

### **6️⃣ How do Virtual Threads compare with true async models (like WebFlux)?**

| Feature                    | WebFlux (Reactive)    | Virtual Threads            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Model                      | Event loop, callbacks | Threads (Virtual)          |
| Async style                | True non-blocking     | Blocking style (but parks) |
| Coding style               | Reactive (Mono/Flux)  | Normal imperative Java     |
| Learning curve             | High                  | Low                        |
| Thread usage               | Few OS threads        | Many Virtual Threads       |
| Throughput (IO-heavy)      | High                  | Also high                  |
| Debugging                  | Complex               | Simple                     |
| Suitable for CPU-heavy app | No                    | Yes                        |

**Key differences:**

* WebFlux is "true async" — uses callbacks and event loop — no thread blocking.
* Virtual Threads use normal blocking code — but under the hood, they park, freeing OS threads.
* WebFlux requires reactive style (`Mono`, `Flux`), which is harder to write and debug.
* Virtual Threads allow traditional Java style — easy for existing codebases.


### **7️⃣ What is an Event Loop model and how is it different from Java's Virtual Thread model?**

An Event Loop is a single-threaded model used in true async frameworks like Node.js or WebFlux. It works like this:

- A single thread (the event loop) repeatedly checks for new events (IO completions, timers, etc.).

- When an IO operation completes, a callback is executed.

- No blocking is allowed — all IO is async.

**Differences from Java Virtual Threads:**

* Event Loop: Single thread, no blocking allowed, uses callbacks.

* Virtual Threads: Many lightweight threads, blocking code allowed (but parked under the hood).

* Event Loop needs async code style (Promises, Mono/Flux); Virtual Threads can use normal Java blocking style.

### **8️⃣ FAQ (Common Doubts)**

**Q: Is Platform Thread only for Java?**
**A:** Yes — the term *Platform Thread* is used only in Java (post Java 19) to refer to a thread backed by an OS thread. Other languages (Python, JS) use different models.

**Q: Where do Virtual Threads park?**
**A:** When blocked, Virtual Threads are parked by the JVM. Their state is saved in memory — no OS thread is wasted.

**Q: Who manages scheduling now?**
**A:** Platform Threads → OS Scheduler.
Virtual Threads → JVM Scheduler.

**Q: Why are Virtual Threads lightweight?**
**A:** They use less memory, avoid OS context switching, and do not block OS threads on IO.

**Q: What does "multiplexed" mean?**
**A:** Many Virtual Threads share a small pool of OS threads — they take turns running on those threads.

**Q: Are Virtual Threads truly non-blocking?**
**A:** No — Virtual Threads can run blocking code (for example, waiting on network or DB). They appear to block in code, but behind the scenes the JVM parks the thread instead of wasting an OS thread. This is different from true non-blocking async models like WebFlux, where no thread is ever blocked.
