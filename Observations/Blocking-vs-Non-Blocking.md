**Understanding Blocking vs Non-Blocking in Threading**

---

### 1. Initial Understanding

Here‚Äôs how we understood it: In a multithreading situation, when we give a task to a thread, it obviously runs in the background. Now, when it comes to getting a result‚Äîlike writing the result back or fetching it‚Äî**that‚Äôs where blocking seems to happen**. Even though the thread runs separately, when it comes to this result-return part, it kind of turns synchronous. That's the blocking part in our opinion.

Whereas in **non-blocking**, we understood it like‚Äîeven when the result is about to come, the thread doesn't pause there. It doesn't become synchronous. Instead, it keeps running asynchronously and continues to do other things without waiting for that result. When the result comes, it just picks it up and continues.

---

### 2. Clarified Understanding (Thread Behavior)

so the real idea is this: **blocking and non-blocking are thread behaviors**‚Äînot necessarily tied to whether the code is synchronous or asynchronous. Asynchronous is more about the programming model, whereas blocking is about what a **thread does when it's waiting**.

* In **blocking**, when a thread makes a call (like to an API, a DB, or reads a file), it just **sits idle** until the response comes back. It doesn‚Äôt go take other tasks.
* In **non-blocking**, the thread **doesn‚Äôt wait**. It triggers the call, registers a callback (or something similar), and moves on to other work. When the response comes, it‚Äôs handled later‚Äîmaybe by the same thread or another.

---

### 3. Is Blocking Only Caused by External Systems?

This was a major insight for us. We thought blocking behavior only happens when a thread is waiting for an external source (like DB/API/File). But it turns out, that‚Äôs not the full story.

Yes, **most of the time** blocking is seen with external systems because they are slow, and the thread has no choice but to wait. But even inside our own application, blocking can still happen:

* **Thread.sleep() / wait() / join():** No external call here, but the thread still goes into a blocked state.
* **Locks / synchronized blocks:** If one thread holds a lock, the others trying to acquire it are blocked.
* **Heavy computations:** Not technically ‚Äúblocked‚Äù but the thread is fully consumed, so it can't take on any other tasks‚Äîfeels like blocking in effect.

So yeah‚Äîblocking wasn‚Äôt *only* about I/O. It‚Äôs really any case where a thread gets stuck and can‚Äôt move forward until something completes, whether it's internal or external.

---

### 4. Core Summary

* **Blocking**: Thread waits and does nothing else till the task (usually slow) completes.
* **Non-blocking**: Thread doesn‚Äôt wait. It moves on and comes back to the task when the result is ready.
* Most blocking is seen during **external operations**, but it also happens with **internal waits or locks**.
* It‚Äôs more about **how the thread behaves** than whether the code is async or sync.








A practical code example to the doc, showing both blocking and non-blocking approaches using Java and an external HTTP API call :

* **Blocking version**: `HttpURLConnection`
* **Non-blocking version**: `WebClient` from Spring WebFlux (reactive)

### 5. Code Example ‚Äì Blocking vs Non-Blocking with External API Call

We wanted to see this concept with real Java code‚Äîwhere we‚Äôre making a call to an external system (say a public HTTP API like `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`) and observing the thread behavior.

---

#### 5.1 Blocking Example using `HttpURLConnection`

```java
public class BlockingHttpExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

        System.out.println("Blocking call started on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        URL url = new URL("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        conn.setRequestMethod("GET");

        try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()))) {
            String inputLine;
            StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder();
            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
                content.append(inputLine);
            }
            System.out.println("Response: " + content);
        }

        long duration = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        System.out.println("Blocking call completed in " + duration + " ms");
    }
}
```

üîπ This example is **completely blocking**‚Äîuntil the HTTP response is fetched, the thread does nothing else.

---

#### 5.2 Non-Blocking Example using `WebClient` (Spring WebFlux)

```java
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public class NonBlockingHttpExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WebClient client = WebClient.create("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com");

        System.out.println("Non-blocking call triggered on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        Mono<String> responseMono = client.get()
                .uri("/todos/1")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class);

        responseMono.subscribe(response -> {
            System.out.println("Response received on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            System.out.println("Response: " + response);
        });

        System.out.println("Main thread continues without waiting...");
        
        // Optional delay so the app doesn't exit immediately before async completes
        try { Thread.sleep(3000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    }
}
```

üîπ This is **non-blocking**‚Äîthe call is made, and the main thread **continues immediately**. When the response is ready, it is handled via a **callback** (`subscribe`).
