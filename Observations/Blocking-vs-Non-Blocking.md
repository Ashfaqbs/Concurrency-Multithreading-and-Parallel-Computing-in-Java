**Understanding Blocking vs Non-Blocking in Threading**

---

### 1. Initial Understanding

Here’s how we understood it: In a multithreading situation, when we give a task to a thread, it obviously runs in the background. Now, when it comes to getting a result—like writing the result back or fetching it—**that’s where blocking seems to happen**. Even though the thread runs separately, when it comes to this result-return part, it kind of turns synchronous. That's the blocking part in our opinion.

Whereas in **non-blocking**, we understood it like—even when the result is about to come, the thread doesn't pause there. It doesn't become synchronous. Instead, it keeps running asynchronously and continues to do other things without waiting for that result. When the result comes, it just picks it up and continues.

### 2. Clarified Understanding (Thread Behavior)

so the real idea is this: **blocking and non-blocking are thread behaviors**—not necessarily tied to whether the code is synchronous or asynchronous. Asynchronous is more about the programming model, whereas blocking is about what a **thread does when it's waiting**.

* In **blocking**, when a thread makes a call (like to an API, a DB, or reads a file), it just **sits idle** until the response comes back. It doesn’t go take other tasks.
* In **non-blocking**, the thread **doesn’t wait**. It triggers the call, registers a callback (or something similar), and moves on to other work. When the response comes, it’s handled later—maybe by the same thread or another.

### 3. Is Blocking Only Caused by External Systems?

This was a major insight for us. We thought blocking behavior only happens when a thread is waiting for an external source (like DB/API/File). But it turns out, that’s not the full story.

Yes, **most of the time** blocking is seen with external systems because they are slow, and the thread has no choice but to wait. But even inside our own application, blocking can still happen:

* **Thread.sleep() / wait() / join():** No external call here, but the thread still goes into a blocked state.
* **Locks / synchronized blocks:** If one thread holds a lock, the others trying to acquire it are blocked.
* **Heavy computations:** Not technically “blocked” but the thread is fully consumed, so it can't take on any other tasks—feels like blocking in effect.

So yeah—blocking wasn’t *only* about I/O. It’s really any case where a thread gets stuck and can’t move forward until something completes, whether it's internal or external.

### 4. Core Summary

* **Blocking**: Thread waits and does nothing else till the task (usually slow) completes.
* **Non-blocking**: Thread doesn’t wait. It moves on and comes back to the task when the result is ready.
* Most blocking is seen during **external operations**, but it also happens with **internal waits or locks**.
* It’s more about **how the thread behaves** than whether the code is async or sync.
