## Goal: Async + Non-Blocking

The comparison here is between **WebFlux** (reactive and non-blocking) and **Virtual Threads** (from Project Loom). Both aim to improve scalability, but they approach the problem with fundamentally different models.

---

## 1. WebFlux (Reactive + Non-Blocking)

* Based on **Project Reactor** using the Publisher/Subscriber pattern.
* Built on **non-blocking I/O (NIO)** and an **event loop** model.
* Operates with a small number of threads. A single thread can handle thousands of concurrent requests.
* Does not block threads. Execution continues when data is available via signals (e.g., `Mono`, `Flux`).

### Thread Model

* Minimal threads, often one per core.
* Threads are never blocked; execution is resumed through event callbacks.

### Example

```java
@GetMapping("/data")
public Mono<String> getData() {
    return webClient.get()
        .uri("/api")
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono(String.class); // non-blocking
}
```

## 2. Virtual Threads (Project Loom)

* Each request or task is executed in a **lightweight virtual thread**.
* Supports **blocking-style code**, but the JVM efficiently manages suspension and resumption.
* Internally, blocking is handled by the JVM without tying up platform (OS) threads.

### Blocking Characteristics

* Uses blocking semantics, but the blocking is lightweight and does not consume OS thread resources inefficiently.

### Thread Model

* One virtual thread per task or request.
* Virtual threads are multiplexed over a smaller pool of OS threads, called carrier threads.
* Allows standard imperative programming without the need for reactive constructs.

### Example

```java
@GetMapping("/data")
public String getData() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject("http://api/data", String.class); // blocking call in a virtual thread
}
```

## Key Differences: WebFlux vs Virtual Threads

| Feature                            | WebFlux                               | Virtual Threads                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Thread model                       | Small number of event-loop threads    | Many lightweight virtual threads                     |
| Blocking allowed?                  | No                                    | Yes, efficiently handled                             |
| Programming model                  | Reactive / Functional                 | Traditional / Imperative                             |
| Learning curve                     | Higher                                | Lower (feels like classic Java)                      |
| Performance under high concurrency | Excellent (when used correctly)       | Excellent (simpler migration path for existing apps) |
| Ideal for                          | Fully non-blocking, event-driven apps | Scaling legacy or blocking-style code                |
| Underlying technology              | Project Reactor, Netty                | Native JVM support (Project Loom)                    |

## Summary

* **WebFlux** is truly asynchronous and non-blocking, leveraging a reactive model for high scalability.
* **Virtual Threads** provide an easier way to write concurrent applications by using traditional blocking code patterns while maintaining performance and scalability through efficient JVM thread management.
